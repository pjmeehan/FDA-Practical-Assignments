# FDA-Practical-Assignments

Outline

Section 1. Give general background and answer 'why was it created'? <br>
Section 2. use matplotlib to graph each of the four sets. Provide comments on findings. <br>
Section 3. use scripts from prog. and scripting project to help with this. provide each set with it's own desription table. <br>
Section 4. why dataset is interesting. provide some insight. <br>
References


Do all the above in a Jupyter notebook with good organization and flow.

Provide instructions (if needed) to run the jupyter notebook.

NOTES:
The Jupyter notebook is laid out in 4 sections, each representing the 4 tasks in the problem statement, followed by references. <br>
Section 1. Includes a very brief explanation of Anscombe's quartet and a statement as to why I thought it was created. <br>

Section 2. In this section, the tools are brought in to complete the plots and the descriptive statistics. This is where the python libraries are importedas well as the datasets in the form of csv files. Then the plots are created to give a good visualization of the data. Lastly, a final short comment om the results. <br>

Section 3. Using the libraries and data files from above, the statistical summaries are created. <br>

Section 4. The conclusion. Tying the plots and statistical summaries together, I conform a conclusion as to the importance of the dataset and
why it is interesting. <br>

References. I did not use alot of references for a couple of reasons. 1. I did not do alot of writing on the subject as I believe the subject is meant to be a quick study in learning about being careful when analyzing the summary data. This only tells one side of the story. You should also include visualization tools such as graphs to get a complete picture. 2. For the plotting and descriptive statistics, I relied on my notes and projects from Programming and Scripting from last semester.
